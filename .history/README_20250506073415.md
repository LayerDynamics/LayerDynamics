# LayerDynmamics

Hello, **I'm Ryan O'Boyle, aka LayerDynmamics.** I'm a developer with a focus on machine learning and web development as well as security focused design. With a obsession for developing, understanding and deploying machine learning models, I have experience in various programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and Rust, as well as frameworks such as PyTorch, Deno, FastAPI, and the MERN stack. I enjoy working on projects that involve data analysis, machine learning, and web development, information security, and developer tooling.
