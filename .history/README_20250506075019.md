### Who I am : 

**I'm Ryan O'Boyle, aka LayerDynmamics.** I'm a developer with a focus on machine learning and web development with a obsession for developing, understanding and deploying machine learning models, I have experience in various programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and Rust, as well as frameworks such as PyTorch, Deno, FastAPI, and the MERN stack.

## Projects

- [Rex-ORM](https://github.com/LayerDynamics/rex-orm): A modern TypeScript ORM for Deno with PostgreSQL/SQLite support(more coming), real-time sync, GraphQL generation, and seamless serverless deployment. Built for type-safety and developer productivity.

- [Node-Rust-PTY](https://github.com/LayerDynamics/node-rust-pty): A high-performance Node.js native module providing comprehensive PTY (pseudo-terminal) functionality with virtual DOM-based rendering and advanced session management, implemented in Rust with N-API bindings.

- [ Stega ](https://github.com/LayerDynamics/stega): A modern CLI framework built for Deno that enables developers to create sophisticated command-line applications with features like workflow automation, template generation, and service management. It combines type safety with powerful abstractions to streamline CLI development.

- [ Scriptic ](https://github.com/LayerDynamics/scriptic): A minimalist, embeddable Python REPL with zero external dependencies. It's a simple yet powerful tool for interactive Python development.
