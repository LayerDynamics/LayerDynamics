# LayerDynmamics


### Who I am : 

I'm **Ryan O'Boyle**, aka **LayerDynmamics**. I'm a developer with a focus on machine learning and web development with an obsession for developing, understanding and deploying machine learning models, I have experience in various programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and Rust, as well as frameworks such as PyTorch, Deno, FastAPI, and the MERN stack.

## Projects

- [**Rex-ORM**](https://github.com/LayerDynamics/rex-orm): A modern TypeScript ORM for Deno with PostgreSQL/SQLite support(more coming), real-time sync, GraphQL generation, and seamless serverless deployment. Built for type-safety and developer productivity.

- [**Node-Rust-PTY**](https://github.com/LayerDynamics/node-rust-pty): A high-performance Node.js native module providing comprehensive PTY (pseudo-terminal) functionality with virtual DOM-based rendering and advanced session management, implemented in Rust with N-API bindings.

- [**Stega**](https://github.com/LayerDynamics/stega): A modern CLI framework built for Deno that enables developers to create sophisticated command-line applications with features like workflow automation, template generation, and service management. It combines type safety with powerful abstractions to streamline CLI development.

- [**Scriptic**](https://github.com/LayerDynamics/scriptic): A minimalist, embeddable Python REPL with zero external dependencies. It's a simple yet powerful tool for interactive Python development.

- [**MDX-to-JSON**](https://github.com/LayerDynamics/mdx-to-json): A Web application designed to transform MDX (Markdown with JSX) files into structured JSON format. This tool bridges the gap between rich, interactive MDX content and machine-readable JSON data, making it invaluable for content management systems, documentation platforms, and data processing pipelines that need to work with MDX content programmatically.

- [ **TGC** ](https://github.com/LayerDynamics/tgc): TypeGraph Compiler (TGC) - A high-performance TypeScript compiler and bundler powered by WebAssembly that leverages graph theory for intelligent dependency management. Features cross-platform binary generation, granular security controls, and advanced optimization through a hybrid TypeScript/Rust architecture.
